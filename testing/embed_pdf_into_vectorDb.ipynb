      "1. Creation:  This is the initial step of process execution activity. Process creation means the construction of a new process for the execution. This might \n",

      "• When we start the computer, system creates several background processes.  \n",

      "2. Scheduling/Dispatchi ng: The event or activity in which the state of the process is changed from ready to running. It means the operating system puts \n",
      "the process from ready state into the running state. Dispatching is done by operating system when the resources are free or t he process has higher \n",
      "priority than the ongoing process. There are various other cases in which the process in running state is preempted and proce ss in ready state is \n",
